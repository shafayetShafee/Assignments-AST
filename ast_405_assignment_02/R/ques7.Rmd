## Answer To Ques 07

```{r Table-09}

## ------- Code for Question-08 ------------------------

m4 <- lm(chol ~ age + dibpat, data = mydat)
m4 %>% mod_tab()

```

The fitted regression line is:
```{r eq04}
reg_eq(m4, 4)
```

\interpret

Since `Type A1` subjects are reference group,

* Mean cholesterol level of subjects with age 0 and `Type A` pattern is `r   params(m4, 1)` unit.
* Mean cholesterol level increases about `r params(m4, 2)` for 1-year increase    of age, holding dibpat fixed.
* Mean cholesterol level of `Type B2` subjects is `r -params(m4, 3)` unit lower than that of `Type A` dibpat subjects, holding the subject's age fixed.

Here, Both the regression coefficients corresponding to age and dibpat (Eq \ref{eq: eq4}) have changed from the case of simple linear regression in Eq \ref{eq: eq1} and Eq \ref{eq: eq2}. And also the value of $R^2_{adj}$ increased.
