## Answer To Ques 06

```{r Table-08}

## ------- Code for Question-05 ------------------------

m3 <- lm(chol ~ behpat, data = mydat)
m3 %>% mod_tab()

```

The fitted regression line is:
```{r eq03}
reg_eq(m3, 3)
```

\underline{\texttt{Interpretation of regression coefficients:}}

Since `Type A1` Behavior pattern subjects are reference group,

* Mean cholesterol level of `Type A1` subjects is `r params(m3, 1)` unit.
* Mean cholesterol level of `Type A2` subjects is `r params(m3, 2)` unit         lower than that of `Type A1` subjects.
* Mean cholesterol level of `Type B3` subjects is `r params(m3, 3)` unit         lower than that of `Type A1` subjects.
* Mean cholesterol level of `Type B4` subjects is `r params(m3, 4)` unit         lower than that of `Type A1` subjects.
