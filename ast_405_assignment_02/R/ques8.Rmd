## Answer To Ques 08

```{r Table-10}

## ------- Code for Question-08 ------------------------

mydat %>%
  mutate(age40 = age - 40) %>%
  lm(chol ~ age40, data = .) -> m5

m5 %>% mod_tab()

```

The new fitted model after subtracting 40 from the variable `age` is:
```{r eq05}
reg_eq(m5, 5)
```

\underline{\texttt{Interpretation of regression coefficients:}}

* Since the explanatory variable is age minus 40, we can say, the mean cholesterol    level of a 40 year old subject is `r params(m5, 1)`.
* Mean cholesterol level is expected to in increase by `r params(m5, 2)` for 1 year   increase of age.

The main difference of this model (Eq \ref{eq: eq1}) compared to model \ref{eq: eq5} is that, we can interpret the intercept term for this model logically.
