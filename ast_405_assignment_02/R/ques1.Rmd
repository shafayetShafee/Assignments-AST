## Answer To Ques 01
For the continuous variables `age` and `bmi`, mean and standard deviation (SD) is obtained. And for categorical variable `arcus`, `behpat` and `chd69`, frequency and proportion (in percentage) is obtained as descriptive statistics, which are shown in the following table:

```{r Table-01}

## ------- Code for Question-01 ------------------------

tab <- CreateTableOne(
  data = mydat,
  vars = c("age", "bmi", "arcus", "behpat", "chd69"),
  factorVars = "arcus",
  addOverall = TRUE
)

tab_p <- print(tab, showAllLevels = TRUE, printToggle = FALSE)

kab_tab(tab_p,
        caption = "Descriptive Statistics") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")

```
