## Answer To Ques 09

```{r Table-11}
## ------- Code for Question-08 ------------------------

m6 <- lm(chol ~ dibpat * smoke, data = mydat)
m6 %>% mod_tab()
```

In this case, the fitted model is:
```{r eq06}
reg_eq(m6, 6)
```

\underline{\texttt{Interpretation of regression coefficients:}}

Here the reference groups are `Non-smoker` and dibpat `Type A` subjects. So,

* The mean cholesterol level of Type A non smoker subject is `r params(m6, 1)` unit.
* Among the non-smokers, mean cholesterol level of dibpat `Type B` subjects is `r -params(m6, 2)` unit lower compared to `Type A` subject.
* Among the `Type A` subjects, mean cholesterol level of smokers is `r params(m6, 3)` unit higher than that of non-smokers.
* Difference of mean cholesterol level between smokers and non-smokers is `r params(m6, 4)` unit higher in `Type B` dibpat subjects compared to that of `Type A` dibpat subjects.
